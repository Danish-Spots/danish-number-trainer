# DanishNumberTrainer

This was a project I had an idea to create.
The numbers in Danish can be kind of hard to learn, so I decided to create this small game to try and help.
You get a number in written form (for example, en) and you have to guess the correct answer out of 4 options.
Upong guessing 3 of the options will turn red and 1 will turn green.
If you got it right, you get 1 point.
If you didnt get it right, you lose all points and start from 0 again.

Have fun :)
